# Data mining for urban drainage systems analysis
These codes are for testing the clustering algorithms' peformance in grouping time-series water depth data of urban drainage systems. Please refer to the MDPI_water paper [Is Clustering Time-series Water Depth Useful? An Exploratory Study for Flooding Detection in Urban Drainage Systems](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/9/2433)
